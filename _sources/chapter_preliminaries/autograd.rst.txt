Automatic Differentiation
=========================


Recall from :numref:`sec_calculus` that calculating derivatives is the
crucial step in all the optimization algorithms that we will use to
train deep networks. While the calculations are straightforward, working
them out by hand can be tedious and error-prone, and these issues only
grow as our models become more complex.

Fortunately all modern deep learning frameworks take this work off our
plates by offering *automatic differentiation* (often shortened to
*autograd*). As we pass data through each successive function, the
framework builds a *computational graph* that tracks how each value
depends on others. To calculate derivatives, automatic differentiation
works backwards through this graph applying the chain rule. The
computational algorithm for applying the chain rule in this fashion is
called *backpropagation*.

While autograd libraries have become a hot concern over the past decade,
they have a long history. In fact the earliest references to autograd
date back over half of a century :cite:`Wengert.1964`. The core ideas
behind modern backpropagation date to a PhD thesis from 1980
:cite:`Speelpenning.1980` and were further developed in the late 1980s
:cite:`Griewank.1989`. While backpropagation has become the default
method for computing gradients, it is not the only option. For instance,
the Julia programming language employs forward propagation
:cite:`Revels.Lubin.Papamarkou.2016`. Before exploring methods, let’s
first master the autograd package.

    import mlx.core as mx

A Simple Function
-----------------

Let’s assume that we are interested in differentiating the function
:math:`y = 2\mathbf{x}^{\top}\mathbf{x}` with respect to the column
vector :math:`\mathbf{x}`. To start, we assign ``x`` an initial value.

.. raw:: latex

   \diilbookstyleinputcell

.. code:: python

    x = mx.arange(4.0)
    x




.. raw:: latex

   \diilbookstyleoutputcell

.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    array([0, 1, 2, 3], dtype=float32)



We now calculate our function of ``x`` and assign the result to ``y``.

.. raw:: latex

   \diilbookstyleinputcell

.. code:: python

    y = lambda x: 2 * mx.tensordot(x, x, axes=1)
    y(x)




.. raw:: latex

   \diilbookstyleoutputcell

.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    array(28, dtype=float32)



.. raw:: latex

   \diilbookstyleinputcell

.. code:: python

    # The `grad` transform returns a Python function that
    # computes the gradient of the original function
    x_grad = mx.grad(y)(x)
    x, x_grad




.. raw:: latex

   \diilbookstyleoutputcell

.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    (array([0, 1, 2, 3], dtype=float32), array([0, 4, 8, 12], dtype=float32))



We already know that the gradient of the function
:math:`y = 2\mathbf{x}^{\top}\mathbf{x}` with respect to
:math:`\mathbf{x}` should be :math:`4\mathbf{x}`. We can now verify that
the automatic gradient computation and the expected result are
identical.

.. raw:: latex

   \diilbookstyleinputcell

.. code:: python

    x_grad == 4 * x




.. raw:: latex

   \diilbookstyleoutputcell

.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    array([True, True, True, True], dtype=bool)



.. raw:: latex

   \diilbookstyleinputcell

.. code:: python

    y = lambda x: x.sum()
    mx.grad(y)(x)




.. raw:: latex

   \diilbookstyleoutputcell

.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    array([1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=float32)



Backward for Non-Scalar Variables
---------------------------------

When ``y`` is a vector, the most natural representation of the
derivative of ``y`` with respect to a vector ``x`` is a matrix called
the *Jacobian* that contains the partial derivatives of each component
of ``y`` with respect to each component of ``x``. Likewise, for
higher-order ``y`` and ``x``, the result of differentiation could be an
even higher-order tensor.

While Jacobians do show up in some advanced machine learning techniques,
more commonly we want to sum up the gradients of each component of ``y``
with respect to the full vector ``x``, yielding a vector of the same
shape as ``x``. For example, we often have a vector representing the
value of our loss function calculated separately for each example among
a *batch* of training examples. Here, we just want to sum up the
gradients computed individually for each example.

.. raw:: latex

   \diilbookstyleinputcell

.. code:: python

    y = lambda x: x * x
    # grad is only defined for scalar output functions
    mx.grad(lambda x: y(x).sum())(x)




.. raw:: latex

   \diilbookstyleoutputcell

.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    array([0, 2, 4, 6], dtype=float32)



Detaching Computation
---------------------

Sometimes, we wish to move some calculations outside of the recorded
computational graph. For example, say that we use the input to create
some auxiliary intermediate terms for which we do not want to compute a
gradient. In this case, we need to *detach* the respective computational
graph from the final result. The following toy example makes this
clearer: suppose we have ``z = x * y`` and ``y = x * x`` but we want to
focus on the *direct* influence of ``x`` on ``z`` rather than the
influence conveyed via ``y``. In this case, we can create a new variable
``u`` that takes the same value as ``y`` but whose *provenance* (how it
was created) has been wiped out. Thus ``u`` has no ancestors in the
graph and gradients do not flow through ``u`` to ``x``. For example,
taking the gradient of ``z = x * u`` will yield the result ``u``, (not
``3 * x * x`` as you might have expected since ``z = x * x * x``).

Note that while this procedure detaches ``y``\ ’s ancestors from the
graph leading to ``z``, the computational graph leading to ``y``
persists and thus we can calculate the gradient of ``y`` with respect to
``x``.

Gradients and Python Control Flow
---------------------------------

So far we reviewed cases where the path from input to output was well
defined via a function such as ``z = x * x * x``. Programming offers us
a lot more freedom in how we compute results. For instance, we can make
them depend on auxiliary variables or condition choices on intermediate
results. One benefit of using automatic differentiation is that even if
building the computational graph of a function required passing through
a maze of Python control flow (e.g., conditionals, loops, and arbitrary
function calls), we can still calculate the gradient of the resulting
variable. To illustrate this, consider the following code snippet where
the number of iterations of the ``while`` loop and the evaluation of the
``if`` statement both depend on the value of the input ``a``.

.. raw:: latex

   \diilbookstyleinputcell

.. code:: python

    def f(a):
        b = a * 2
        while mx.linalg.norm(b) < 1000:
            b = b * 2
        if b.sum() > 0:
            c = b
        else:
            c = 100 * b
        return c

Below, we call this function, passing in a random value, as input. Since
the input is a random variable, we do not know what form the
computational graph will take. However, whenever we execute ``f(a)`` on
a specific input, we realize a specific computational graph and can
subsequently run ``backward``.

.. raw:: latex

   \diilbookstyleinputcell

.. code:: python

    a = mx.random.normal(key=mx.random.key(1))
    d = f(a)
    d_grad = mx.grad(f)(a)

Even though our function ``f`` is, for demonstration purposes, a bit
contrived, its dependence on the input is quite simple: it is a *linear*
function of ``a`` with piecewise defined scale. As such, ``f(a) / a`` is
a vector of constant entries and, moreover, ``f(a) / a`` needs to match
the gradient of ``f(a)`` with respect to ``a``.

.. raw:: latex

   \diilbookstyleinputcell

.. code:: python

    d_grad == d / a




.. raw:: latex

   \diilbookstyleoutputcell

.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    array(True, dtype=bool)



Dynamic control flow is very common in deep learning. For instance, when
processing text, the computational graph depends on the length of the
input. In these cases, automatic differentiation becomes vital for
statistical modeling since it is impossible to compute the gradient *a
priori*.

Discussion
----------

You have now gotten a taste of the power of automatic differentiation.
The development of libraries for calculating derivatives both
automatically and efficiently has been a massive productivity booster
for deep learning practitioners, liberating them so they can focus on
less menial. Moreover, autograd lets us design massive models for which
pen and paper gradient computations would be prohibitively time
consuming. Interestingly, while we use autograd to *optimize* models (in
a statistical sense) the *optimization* of autograd libraries themselves
(in a computational sense) is a rich subject of vital interest to
framework designers. Here, tools from compilers and graph manipulation
are leveraged to compute results in the most expedient and
memory-efficient manner.

For now, try to remember these basics: (i) attach gradients to those
variables with respect to which we desire derivatives; (ii) record the
computation of the target value; (iii) execute the backpropagation
function; and (iv) access the resulting gradient.

Exercises
---------

1. Why is the second derivative much more expensive to compute than the
   first derivative?
2. After running the function for backpropagation, immediately run it
   again and see what happens. Investigate.
3. In the control flow example where we calculate the derivative of
   ``d`` with respect to ``a``, what would happen if we changed the
   variable ``a`` to a random vector or a matrix? At this point, the
   result of the calculation ``f(a)`` is no longer a scalar. What
   happens to the result? How do we analyze this?
4. Let :math:`f(x) = \sin(x)`. Plot the graph of :math:`f` and of its
   derivative :math:`f'`. Do not exploit the fact that
   :math:`f'(x) = \cos(x)` but rather use automatic differentiation to
   get the result.
5. Let :math:`f(x) = ((\log x^2) \cdot \sin x) + x^{-1}`. Write out a
   dependency graph tracing results from :math:`x` to :math:`f(x)`.
6. Use the chain rule to compute the derivative :math:`\frac{df}{dx}` of
   the aforementioned function, placing each term on the dependency
   graph that you constructed previously.
7. Given the graph and the intermediate derivative results, you have a
   number of options when computing the gradient. Evaluate the result
   once starting from :math:`x` to :math:`f` and once from :math:`f`
   tracing back to :math:`x`. The path from :math:`x` to :math:`f` is
   commonly known as *forward differentiation*, whereas the path from
   :math:`f` to :math:`x` is known as backward differentiation.
8. When might you want to use forward, and when backward,
   differentiation? Hint: consider the amount of intermediate data
   needed, the ability to parallelize steps, and the size of matrices
   and vectors involved.
