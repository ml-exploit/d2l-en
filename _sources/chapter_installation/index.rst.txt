Installation
============


In order to get up and running, we will need an environment for running
Python, the Jupyter Notebook, the relevant libraries, and the code
needed to run the book itself.

Installing Miniconda
--------------------

Your simplest option is to install
`Miniconda <https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`__. Note that the
Python 3.x version is required. You can skip the following steps if your
machine already has conda installed.

Visit the Miniconda website and determine the appropriate version for
your system based on your Python 3.x version and machine architecture.
Suppose that your Python version is 3.9 (our tested version). If you are
using macOS, you would download the bash script whose name contains the
strings “MacOSX”, navigate to the download location, and execute the
installation as follows (taking Intel Macs as an example):

.. raw:: latex

   \diilbookstyleinputcell

.. code:: bash

   # The file name is subject to changes
   sh Miniconda3-py39_4.12.0-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -b

A Linux user would download the file whose name contains the strings
“Linux” and execute the following at the download location:

.. raw:: latex

   \diilbookstyleinputcell

.. code:: bash

   # The file name is subject to changes
   sh Miniconda3-py39_4.12.0-Linux-x86_64.sh -b

A Windows user would download and install Miniconda by following its
`online instructions <https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`__. On
Windows, you may search for ``cmd`` to open the Command Prompt
(command-line interpreter) for running commands.

Next, initialize the shell so we can run ``conda`` directly.

.. raw:: latex

   \diilbookstyleinputcell

.. code:: bash

   ~/miniconda3/bin/conda init

Then close and reopen your current shell. You should be able to create a
new environment as follows:

.. raw:: latex

   \diilbookstyleinputcell

.. code:: bash

   conda create --name d2l python=3.9 -y

Now we can activate the ``d2l`` environment:

.. raw:: latex

   \diilbookstyleinputcell

.. code:: bash

   conda activate d2l

Installing the Deep Learning Framework and the ``d2l`` Package
--------------------------------------------------------------

Before installing any deep learning framework, please first check
whether or not you have proper GPUs on your machine (the GPUs that power
the display on a standard laptop are not relevant for our purposes). For
example, if your computer has NVIDIA GPUs and has installed
`CUDA <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads>`__, then you are all
set. If your machine does not house any GPU, there is no need to worry
just yet. Your CPU provides more than enough horsepower to get you
through the first few chapters. Just remember that you will want to
access GPUs before running larger models.

Our next step is to install the ``d2l`` package that we developed in
order to encapsulate frequently used functions and classes found
throughout this book:

.. raw:: latex

   \diilbookstyleinputcell

.. code:: bash

   pip install d2l==1.0.3

Downloading and Running the Code
--------------------------------

Next, you will want to download the notebooks so that you can run each
of the book’s code blocks. Simply click on the “Notebooks” tab at the
top of any HTML page on `the D2L.ai website <https://d2l.ai/>`__ to
download the code and then unzip it. Alternatively, you can fetch the
notebooks from the command line as follows:

If you do not already have ``unzip`` installed, first run
``sudo apt-get install unzip``. Now we can start the Jupyter Notebook
server by running:

.. raw:: latex

   \diilbookstyleinputcell

.. code:: bash

   jupyter notebook

At this point, you can open http://localhost:8888 (it may have already
opened automatically) in your web browser. Then we can run the code for
each section of the book. Whenever you open a new command line window,
you will need to execute ``conda activate d2l`` to activate the runtime
environment before running the D2L notebooks, or updating your packages
(either the deep learning framework or the ``d2l`` package). To exit the
environment, run ``conda deactivate``.
